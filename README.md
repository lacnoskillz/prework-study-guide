# Prework-Study-Guide

## Description

Created this website to store notes that will help with bootcamp. Instead of writing down notes locally I can not store them online. I leanred the basics of HTML, JAVA, CSS, The importance of version control and how to navigate and use GITHUB aswell as the GIT flow. This contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

## Installation
n/a

## Usage
To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows) For me press f12. A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
